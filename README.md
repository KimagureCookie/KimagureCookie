Hey there 👋
I'm KimagureCookie, a recent engineering graduate in Electronics and Instrumentation who's passionate about electronic designs and anything Technical. While I'm still relatively new to the industry, I'm eager to learn and grow as an engineer by taking on challenging problems and developing creative solutions.
On my GitHub profile, you'll find a selection of projects that I've worked on . I believe that open source is a great way to learn and collaborate with others in the industry, and I'm excited to be a part of it.
I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate with others on interesting projects, so if you're interested in working together or just want to connect, feel free to reach out.

Currently, I'm working on a opensource Hot air rework station design.You can check it out here: [uStream](https://github.com/KimagureCookie/uStream).
